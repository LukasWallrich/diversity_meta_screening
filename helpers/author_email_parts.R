tldr <- "I am Lukas Wallrich, a lecturer in Organisational Psychology at the Birkbeck Business School in London. Let me get straight to the point: We are currently conducting a <span style = 'color:#29128c;'>meta-analysis correlating team diversity and team performance</span> (accepted in-principle by the Journal of Business and Psychology, <a href='https://osf.io/f5qdn' style = 'color:#999999;'>https://osf.io/f5qdn</a>). While coding effect sizes, we have identified and included some of your work already – and are now reaching out so see whether there is <span style = 'color:#29128c;'>any additional recent/unpublished/hard-to-find data</span> that you would like to draw our attention to. If so, we would much appreciate it if you could send us the reference, or (even better) a copy."

background1 <- "Some more background: In this meta-analysis, we are considering any studies that link observed levels of diversity (on demographic, cognitive and job-related factors) to team-level performance outcomes, or – in the case of top management teams – firm-level outcomes. For that, we have already included some data from your work in: "

time_caveat <- "(I’m aware that this has been done a <i>long</i> time ago and that your current research interests may be quite different. Nevertheless, we wanted to reach out broadly so that we go beyond the ‘usual suspects.’)"

background2 <- "Overall, we are considering published and unpublished data, in any language (that is amenable to machine translation), with some restrictions on student samples. We have searched the major bibliographic databases up until January 2023, as well as thesis and preprint databases. Thus, we may still be missing <ul style = 'color:#29128c;'>
    <li>the most recent data,</li>
    <li>work that focuses on very specific types of diversity or performance not amenable to keyword searches,</li>
    <li>work that contains diversity only as a covariate, or</li>
    <li>grey literature that is not indexed.</li>
</ul> If anything comes to mind, we would be grateful if you could share references or papers."

unpublished <- "Also, if you have unfinished or unpublished manuscripts, we would appreciate a copy. These will be kept confidential and will not be used for any other purpose other than inclusion in the meta-analysis."

questions <- "If you have any questions, or anything you may wish to share, then we’d be delighted to hear from you."

greeting <- "<p>Best wishes,</p><p>Lukas</p>"
